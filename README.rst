VMCloak
=======

Automated Virtual Machine Generation and Cloaking for Cuckoo Sandbox.

Introduction
------------

VMCloak is a tool to fully create and prepare Virtual Machines that can be
used by Cuckoo Sandbox. In order to create a new Virtual Machine one should
prepare a few configuration values that will be used later on by the tool.

Dependencies
------------

VMCloak relies on a couple of tools and libraries that are required during
the process of generating a new VM.

* Python 2.6+
* mkisofs/genisoimage
* VirtualBox

Usage
-----

In order to run the tool you'll have to provide at the very least all required
variables. For more information on this please refer to the documentation or
go for an trial and error approach.
