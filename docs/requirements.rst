Requirements
============

In order to run VMCloak you'll at the very least require the following
software:

* Python 2.6 or 2.7
* mkisofs *or* genisoimage
* VirtualBox

Furthermore, as of now one requires *root* privileges to run parts of
*VMCloak* (in order to mount the original Windows ISO file.)
