Welcome to VMCloak's documentation!
===================================

**VMCloak** is a utility for automatically creating Virtual Machines with
Windows as guest Operating System. It has been tailored to generate Virtual
Machines directly usable from within `Cuckoo Sandbox
<http://cuckoosandbox.org/>`_, but it can also be used for other purposes
as *Cuckoo*'s components can be omitted through the configuration.
